Installation
============

The package is available on PyPI and can be installed using `pip`.

To install the package, run the following command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install kuehn-et-al-fdm

This command instructs `pip` to:

1. Use the PyPI repository as the primary source for the package.
2. Fall back to the main PyPI repository for any dependencies that are not available on PyPI.

The package dependencies (`numpy`, `pandas`, and `scipy`) do not have specific version requirements, so installing this package with `pip` should not interfere with a Conda environment.

To **upgrade** to the latest version, run the following command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --upgrade kuehn-et-al-fdm

To check the version installed in your environment, run the following command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip show kuehn-et-al-fdm
