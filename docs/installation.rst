Installation
============

The package is currently available in beta mode on Test PyPI and can be installed using `pip`.

To install the package, run the following command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ kuehn-et-al-fdm

This command instructs `pip` to:

1. Use the Test PyPI repository as the primary source for the package.
2. Fall back to the main PyPI repository for any dependencies that are not available on Test PyPI.
